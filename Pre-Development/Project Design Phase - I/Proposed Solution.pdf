	Problem Statement (Problem to be solved)	Customer can use the app to browse the products and add them to their shopping cart. The bot will assist users in receiving product recommendation. 
	Idea / Solution description	We have come up with a new innovative solution through which you can directly do your online shopping based on your choice without any search. It can be done by using the chatbot. 
	Novelty / Uniqueness 	Share design inspirations to chatbot.
Utilize user's 3D model to find an outfit.
	Social Impact / Customer Satisfaction	Instead of navigating to several screens for booking products online, the user can directly talk to Chatbot regarding the products. 
We can visualize ourselves as a 3D model, for the better understanding of how the product suits us. 
	Business Model (Revenue Model)	While getting a big order from a major retailer might sound like a good thing for a fledgling brand, it means the brand has a short time to somehow produce that inventory and hire the necessary employees without any money upfront 
	Scalability of the Solution	Technological developments such as color changes and the integration of conductive sensors etc. Could revolutionize the way designers think about fashion.
